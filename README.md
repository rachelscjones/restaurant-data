## Notes, Assumptions & Improvements

* Solution does require data to be entered into the postcode search box
* BUT it doesn't check if the postcode is a valid one before searching on it. I was hoping to use a gem called uk_postcode to validate data before making the API call but I couldn't get it to work. An improvement I'd like to make would be to work on this further!
* So currently, if a non-valid postcode is entered, the search returns nothing...
